       <h2>They all start as rocks...</h2>
         <blockquote><span class="strong">...But not all rocks are equal.</span>
         Hello! My name is Eric Hoffman and I am a precision gem cutter, certified by the U.S. Faceters Guild. Every stone I sell
         is made from fairly traded rough, carefully selected and personally faceted by me.<br><br>
         Yes, there are many inexpensive gemstones from overseas these days,
         quick-cut by poorly trained workers. As a proud American artisan, however,
         I choose my rough carefully and plot the optimal cut and angles
         for each stone to ensure it achieves the maximum beauty and
         brilliance inherent in the native stone. Each facet is
         painstakingly planned and carefully cut to achieve exact meets.
         My precision-faceted gems never show "windows", lopsided symmetry or other
         flaws typically found in imported stones.

         Let's work together to design unique pieces as individual and irreplaceable as <span>you</span> are!</h4>
      <p>I specialize in lost-wax casting, wire work, and upcycling. Upcycling means
        taking something you'd throw out or
        recycle and reworking it into something new. For example, dismantling a
        computer power supply, salvaging the copper wire, making that wire into rings,
        and creating a chainmaille bracelet. Or turning your dad’s old class ring into the base for a next-generation engagement ring!

      <p>Argentium silver is my favorite jewlery base. It's .930 sterling
        silver with more Germanium in the mix, which makes it extremely tarnish-resistant.
      <br>
        I also happily play with gold, platinum, copper, steel, titanium, brass, aluminum,
        mercury…(Kidding about mercury. Just checking if you were paying attention).
      </p>
      <p>My newest venture is <strong>refining gold and other precious metals </strong>
        reclaimed from everything from old electronics to
        defunct medical equipment. This means I can realloy to <strong>change your gold jewelry's existing color</strong>
      (for example, you'd like your 18K white gold
        transformed into 14K rose gold)! I love <strong>incorporating vintage
        items </strong>into new work, either integrating it into a custom design or recasting
        it to create something completely new. I'll also <strong>buy your old
        gold &amp; silver</strong> outright if you just want to upcycle it for the world to enjoy.
